### Description

This is a game for the raylib gamejam and is about finishing a gamejam. The theme for the gamejam was "THAT WAS CLOSE" and reminded me about something that my teacher said when we failed at some task: "OOOOH, YOU TRIED AND YOU FAILED!".
The mechanics of the game are 3 minigames displayer randomly.

### Controls

Keyboard:
 - PRESS THE SPACEBAR WHEN THE BAR APPEARS
 - CLICK ON THE CIRCLES
